# Password Generator

## Description:

I wanted to build this project in order to improve my skills as a web developer. I felt that this was a very realistic approach and application of my skills while still challenging myself. This generator can randomly create secure passwords based on customizable options that are prompted to the user. I learned a lot about concatonation and randomizing values.
